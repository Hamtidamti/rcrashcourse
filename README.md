Hi and welcome to the 2020 D-GESS Crashcourse with R! 

Are you excited for your first semester? Have you heard that your degree will be a lot about programming and that you will be using a lot of R? If you don’t know R yet, don’t worry! We are happy to help, because we know how you feel. We offer an R-Bootcamp for beginners and those who would like to refresh the basics. You can find the program of the course attached. Feel free to participate on both days, or just on one.
